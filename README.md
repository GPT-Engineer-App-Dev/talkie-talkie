# talkie-talkie

Implement the main chat view for a WhatsApp-like chat application with these elements:

- A left sidebar showing the user's profile pic and name, and a list of their conversation threads. Show the contact name, profile pic, and latest message preview for each conversation.
- The main panel on the right showing the currently selected conversation. Show the contact name and pic at the top. 
- Display chat messages in bubbles, with different colors for incoming vs outgoing messages. Include a text input at the bottom to send a new message.
- Use a clean, modern design with a light background and WhatsApp's green color for accents.

For now, hardcode some sample conversations and messages. We'll wire it up to real data later.
